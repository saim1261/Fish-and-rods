# Fish-and-rods DevOps project:

This is the read.me for my fish & rods project.

# Brief

The project required me to do the following:
- Create a CRUD application.
- Use & produce a Trello board.
- Use a relational database with at least two tables.
- Produce a front-end website.
- Carry out and document unit and integration tests.
- Use a VCS.
- Deploy this all to a cloud-based virtual machine
